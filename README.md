# Gosper

Glider Labs app framework and development utility.

Gosper is a tool for setting up and developing Golang apps (optionally with React)
based on [github.com/gliderlabs/pkg/com](https://github.com/gliderlabs/pkg/tree/master/com).

This means highly modularized, extensible, and otherwise fairly opinionated. Our
first priority is serving Glider Labs apps before making this a general use
framework.

# Pre-release Install

We're not yet cutting releases of Gosper and its packages. To install the Gosper
CLI, clone the repo and:

```
$ make install
```

You'll need [Go](http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book/get_setup) and
[Glide](https://glide.sh/) installed, so perhaps run `brew bundle` first.

# Slack

Join [Glider Labs Slack](http://glider-slackin.herokuapp.com/) and the `#gosper`
channel to talk about the project.
